      The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle or the hydrological
      cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below
      the surface of the Earth. The mass of water on Earth remains fairly
      constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major
      reservoirs of ice, fresh water, saline water (Salt Water) and
      atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic
      variables. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from
      river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical
      processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration,
      surface runoff, and subsurface flow. In doing so, the water goes through
      different forms: liquid, solid (ice) and vapor.

      The water cycle involves the exchange of energy, which leads to
      temperature changes. When water evaporates, it takes up energy from its
      surroundings and cools the environment. When it condenses, it releases
      energy and warms the environment. These heat exchanges influence
      climate.

      The evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes
      the land with freshwater. The flow of liquid water and ice transports
      minerals across the globe. It is also involved in reshaping the
      geological features of the Earth, through processes including erosion
      and sedimentation. The water cycle is also essential for the maintenance
      of most life and ecosystems on the planet.

      The sun, which drives the water cycle, heats water in oceans and seas.
      Water evaporates as water vapor into the air. Some ice and snow
      sublimates directly into water vapor. Evapotranspiration is water
      transpired from plants and evaporated from the soil. The water molecule
      H2O has smaller molecular mass than the major components of the
      atmosphere, nitrogen and oxygen, N2 and O2, hence is less dense. Due to
      the significant difference in density, buoyancy drives humid air higher.
      As altitude increases, air pressure decreases and the temperature drops
      (see Gas laws). The lower temperature causes water vapor to condense
      into tiny liquid water droplets which are heavier than the air, and fall
      unless supported by an updraft. A huge concentration of these droplets
      over a large space up in the atmosphere become visible as cloud. Some
      condensation is near ground level, and called fog.
